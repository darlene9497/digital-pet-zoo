# 🐾 My Digital Pet Zoo

A playful Python project where you can create your own virtual pets, train them, and see how they spend their day with random activities! 🐶🐱🐰

3. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
python main.py
```
## 🧠 Concepts practiced
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Working with class attributes and methods
- Random module usage (random.randint, random.choice, random.sample)
- Function dispatch using getattr()
- Edge case handling with max() and min()
- Using emoji and fun sounds to enhance user experience

## 💡 Ideas to Expand
- Add more pet types
- Let the user choose actions instead of random selection
- Add a scoring or badge system for tricks learned
- Add animations or sound effects
- Build a GUI version using Tkinter or Pygame
